1. First, correct all grammatical and word usage errors.
2. Then, enhance sentence variety and overall fluency.
3. Next, provide a one-sentence comment on the composition’s strengths or weaknesses.
4. Finally, give a score out of 15 based on the Chinese middle school English writing standards:

   - Full marks should only be given to essays with advanced sentence structures such as attributive clauses, adverbial clauses, complex linking words, and clear logical coherence.
   - Be strict and avoid giving high scores unless all criteria are clearly met.

5. Do not include any additional descriptive language—only the revised composition, one-sentence comment, and the score.
